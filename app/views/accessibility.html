    <h1>Accessibility statement </h1>

    <p>This accessibility statement applies to the standards manual.</p>

    <p>This website is run by the Department for Education. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this
    website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>

        <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and
        VoiceOver)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

    <p>
